I followed the course AI Tools Policy while working on this project. I used AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT and Claude) as support to optimize my workflow: debugging assistance, learning and confirming library usage (pandas, NetworkX, scikit-learn), receiving code review suggestions, and improving the clarity and structure of documentation and report writing. AI was used to speed up iteration (e.g., interpreting error messages, suggesting alternative implementations, and checking that methodological steps are clearly described), but the project decisions, experimental design, and interpretation of results remain my own. I only submitted work that I understand, can run independently, and can explain in detail.
